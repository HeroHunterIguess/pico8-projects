# Directional

A small and difficult pico-8 platformer game. Has 25 levels, 3 bonus levels, and practice mode with a level switcher. This game is published on Itch.io and Lexaloffle.com

I am currently working on update 1.02, which will have splits in practice mode. 

Also sorry for the absurd amount of backups I should probably delete some old ones but I dont care enough.
